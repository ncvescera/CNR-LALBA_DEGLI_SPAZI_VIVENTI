Abstract.
Assessing
how
many
people
are
exposed
and
where
are
they
located
is
a
crucial
step
in
landslide
risk
management
and
emergency
planning.
Frequently
the
available
population
statistical
data
have
no
sufficient
detail
to
an
accurate
assessment
of
the
potential
exposed
people
to
a
hazardous
phenomenon,
mainly
if
it
occurs
at
the
local
scale,
like
landslides
.
The
present
study
aims
to
apply
the
dasymetric
cartography
technic
to
improve
population
spatial
resolution
and
to
assess
10
potential
exposed
population.
An
additionally
objective
is
to
compare
the
obtained
results
with
a
more
common
approach
that
uses
basic
census
units
in
its
better
spatial
resolution
(BCU)
as
spatial
units.
Considering
the
Portuguese
census
data
and
a
layer
of
residential
building
limits,
whose
area
was
used
as
ancillary
information,
the
number
of
exposed
inhabitants
significantly
differs
between
two
approaches.
Using
BCU
approach
and
considering
the
three
highest
landslide
susceptible
classes,
people
inhabitants
are
overestimated
in
132
%
(2539
inhabitants).
Despite
the
associated
uncertainties
in
a
general
15
cost-benefit
analysis
the
presented
methodology
seems
to
be
a
reliable
approach
as
first
approximation
to
a
more
detailed
estimation
of
exposed
people.
The
approach
based
on
dasymetric
cartography
allows
an
increasing
of
the
spatial
resolution
of
population
over
large
areas
and
enable
the
use
of
detailed
landslide
susceptibility
maps
and
thus
improving
the
population
assessment.

Introduction
In
natural
sciences,
risk
is
function
of
the
probability
of
occurrence
of
a
hazard
scenario
and
the
related
consequences
that
are
expected
on
the
exposed
elements
at
risk
(e.g.
Varnes
and
IAEG,
1984;
Fuchs
et
al.
2013).
Lee
and
Jones
(2004)
consider
25
risk
as
a
“human-centred
concept
that
is
applied
when
human
or
things
that
human
value
were
adversely
impacted”.
So,
assessing
exposed
elements
and
their
vulnerability
are
essential
to
risk
analysis.
However,
the
variety
of
potential
exposed
elements
and
their
different
characteristics
(buildings,
roads,
people,
etc.)
leads
to
a
complex
and
multi-level
analysis,
and
because
of
that
studies
with
more
than
one
type
of
exposed
elements
are
rare
(e.g.

al.,

Promper
and
Glade,
2016).
Nevertheless,
exposure
assessment
and
vulnerability
of
fixed
elements
in
territory
has
received
by
scientific
community
a
special
attention
in
recent
years,
being
specified
the
type
and
number
of
exposed
elements
and
assessed
their
expected
degree
of
loss
(e.g.
Galli
and
Guzzetti,
2007;
Papathoma-Köhle
et
al.,
2007,
2012;
Petrucci
and
Gullà,
2010;

In
social
sciences
many
times
the
focus
is
placed
on
evaluate
how
communities
and
society
in
general
can
couple
with
a
disaster
event
(e.g.
Cutter
et
al.,
2003;
Kienberger
et
al.,
2009;
Mendes,
2009;
Nathan
et
al.,
2010).
Other
studies
tried
to
evaluate
relations
between
process
occurrence
and
damages
to
people,
calculating
the
probability
of
fatalities,
their
acceptability/tolerance
or
combining
approaches
to
making
f-N
curves
(e.g.
HSE,
1992;
Cruden
and
Fell,
1997;
Evans,
1997;
Guzzetti,
2000).
Further
studies
have
been
evaluating
the
probability
of
people
to
be
affected
outside/inside
an
element
(e.g.
10
a
house)
that
is
hit
by
the
hazardous
phenomenon
(e.g.
Ragozin
and
Tikhvinsky,
2000;
Bell
and
Glade,
2004;
Kaynia
et
al.,
2008).
The
abovementioned
studies
are
generally
based
on
historical
data
of
hazard
phenomena
that
affected
population
(e.g.
Dai
et
al.,
2002;
Guzzetti
et
al.,
2005).
However,
these
historical
databases
are
frequently
insufficient
and
incomplete,
which
means
that
“probabilities”
have
been
assumed
frequently
based
on
knowledge
and
judgement
(Michael-Leiba
et
al.,
2003).
For
the
analysis
of
such
dynamic
and
“multi-faceted”
topic
as
vulnerability,
truly
interdisciplinary
research
is
necessary
15
(Fuchs
et
al.,
2011).
In
addition,
different
datasets
of
elements
must
to
be
taken
into
account
(e.g.
building
structure
and
materials,
number
of
inhabitants,
infrastructures
uses,
traffic
volume,
among
several
others)
to
estimate
direct
and
indirect
costs
within
the
quantitative
risk
analysis
(e.g.
Zêzere
et
al.,
2007,
2008;
Remondo
et
al.,
2008;
Corominas
et
al.,
2014;
Schwendtner
et
al.,
2013).
In
other
perspective
the
lack
of
interdisciplinary
and
multi-level
approaches
(e.g.
regional/international,
personal/political)
can
reduce
the
efficiency
of
adopted
policies
to
avoid
disasters
(e.g.
Xanthopoulos,
20
2007;
Aubrecht
et
al.,
2013).
Without
underestimating
the
significance
of
know
the
probability
of
fatalities,
which
is
extremely
important
for
spatial
management,
the
simple
and
accurate
assessment
of
“how
many
people”
is
present
at
a
certain
time
and
space
is
crucial,
for
example,
to
manage
people
evacuation.
To
know
where
potential
exposed
population
are
is
important
but
to
know
it
with
higher
precision
and
accurately
is
mandatory
to
guarantee
the
efficiency
of
emergency
plans
and
to
reduce
associated
costs
25
(e.g.
Bhaduri
et
al.,
2002;
Sutton
et
al.,
2003;
Chen
et
al.,
2004;
Su
et
al.,
2010;
Freire
and
Aubrecht,
2012;
Freire
et
al.
2012;
Aubrecht
et
al.,
2013).
In
fact
according
to
Bhaduri
et
al.
(2002)
locating
population
at
risk
has
to
be
the
first
step
in
saving
lives.
As
base
of
a
complete
risk
assessment
the
location
and
number
of
exposed
people,
with
a
lower
degree
of
uncertainty,
is
mandatory
and
demands
a
harmonization
between
the
resolution
of
the
hazard
and
detailed
population
data
distribution.
A
30
higher
resolution
of
population
distribution
is
mainly
need
when
the
hazard
has
no
extensive
consequences,
as
in
the
case
of
landslides,
where
the
processes
are
more
selective
and
local
damage
related
(Deichmann
et
al.,
2011).
Additionally,
in
larger
study
areas
where
diverse
types
of
occupation
can
take
place
(urban,
rural)
significant
differences
on
population
density
are

expected.
When
the
combination
of
these
two
situations
occurs
(local
hazard
and
sparse
population)
it
becomes
even
more
important
to
know
where
the
exposed
people
are
located.
Potential
affected
people
are
usually
assessed
based
on
inhomogeneous
spatial
units
from
census
data,
which
mainly
indicates
night-time
population
distribution
(e.g.
Freire
and
Aubrecht,
2012;
Aubrecht
et
al.,
2013;
Fraser
et
al.,
2014).
For
this
reason
some
authors
tried
to
evaluate
the
population
fluctuation
(daily,
seasonal,
historical)
to
accurate
their
exposed
5
people
counting
(e.g.
Keiler,
2004;
Keiler
et
al.,
2005;
Freire
and
Aubrecht,
2012;
Schwendtner
et
al.,
2013).
Aubrecht
et
al.
(2010)
provided
a
detailed
approach,
in
a
13
km
2
area,
adding
to
a
high
resolution
land
cover
map
information
about
building
eight
(as
proxy
of
building
capacity)
and
building
use
(residential,
public,
commercial,
others).
Freire
et
al.
(2012)
used
also
a
3D
building
model
to
define
how
many
people
needs
to
be
evacuated
due
to
a
tsunami,
in
a
2.5
km
2
estuarine
area
in
Lisbon.
Fuchs
et
al.
(2015)
assessed
exposure
to
several
hazard
phenomena
in
Austria
based
on
unusual
detailed
property
10
data
information,
as
for
example
height,
net
area,
configuration,
main
use,
for
individual
floors
as
well
population
per
building.
Although,
quite
detailed
methods
for
disaggregation
of
people
and
counting
of
how
many
people
are
exposed
to
a
hazard
have
already
been
tested,
the
need
of
high
detailed
information
does
not
allow
its
widespread
use
in
areas
of
hundreds
of
km
2
.
On
the
other
hand,
in
some
cases,
as
in
Portugal,
due
to
privacy
policies,
the
best
source
of
population
data
(e.g.
census)
are
always
aggregated
which
distort
reality.
Even
in
small
units
as
Basic
Census
Unit
(BCU)
homogeneity
is
not
15
always
achieved;
in
these
cases
the
assumption
of
homogeneity
leads
to
an
error
that
is
greater
as
greater
are
the
diversity
of
uses
(e.g.
residential,
commercial,
agricultural).
In
the
best
cases
BCU
corresponds
to
the
city
block
(in
urban
areas)
but
can
have
a
huge
dispersion
in
sparsely
populated
rural
areas,
which
constrains
a
more
accurate
assessment
of
the
number
and
precise
location
of
people
exposed.
Even
if
the
data
were
collected
individually
an
aggregation
is
done
which
implies
that
is
assumed
a
uniform
distribution
of
population
inside
the
aggregation
unit,
i.e.
population
could
be
distorted
(e.g.
Fisher
and
20
Langford,
1996;
Su
et
al.,
2010).
In
addition
people
can
be
concentrated
in
specific
places
within
a
BCU.
Distribute
population
inside
these
units
is
a
major
goal
of
this
work.
For
this
purpose
an
increasing
of
population
data
resolution
is
needed.
Although
the
objective
is
to
obtain
a
finer
spatial
distribution
of
the
population,
different
methods
and
data
can
be
used,
mainly
when
considering
different
scale
approaches
(Aubrecht
et
al.
2013).
The
adopted
methodology
and
obtained
results
25
are
dependent
on
the
type
and
quality
of
the
input
data
used
as
ancillary
information
to
disaggregate
data
(Su
et
al.,
2010).
In
fact
on
global
scales
(from
world
to
regional
scale),
the
base
to
disaggregate
general
information
is
frequently
a
land
use
map
or
an
accessibility
map
that
allow
to
spatially
distinguish
population
between
urban
and
rural
areas
(e.g.
Eicher
and
Brewer,
2001;
Mennis
and
Hultgren,
2006;
Reibel
and
Agrawal,
2007;
Langford,
2007;
Langford
et
al.,
2008;
Gallego,
2010;
Steinnocher
et
al.,
2011).
The
drawback
of
these
approaches
is
the
limited
spatial
resolution
of
the
land
use
map
that
leads
to
30
over
or
underestimate
population
in
sparsely
populated
areas
(Steinnocher
et
al.,
2011;
Aubrecht
et
al.
2013).
On
local
scales
(municipality
to
parish),
due
to
a
detail
of
input
data,
it
is
possible
to
consider
urban
systems,
with
finer
grid
cells
and
taking
into
account
other
parameters
as
weighting
factors
like
built-up
areas,
roads
typology
or
population
fluctuation
(e.g.
Keiler,
2004;
Reibel
and
Bugalino,
2005;
Freire
and
Aubrecht,
2012;
Fuchs
et
al.,
2013).

In
this
framework,
the
major
aim
of
this
work
is
to
present
a
methodology
to
assess
population
exposed
to
landslides
increasing
the
population
resolution
over
large
areas,
based
on
a
detailed
landslide
susceptibility
map
(pixel
5
m),
the
national
official
statistics,
and
a
simple
building
limits
layer.
This
can
be
considered
as
an
intermediate,
and
quickly
approach
between
coarser
assessment
(e.g.
parish
level)
and
local
time-consuming
detailed
approaches.
Additionally,
the
differences
on
people
exposure
are
assessed
by
comparing
a
more
traditional
approach
(considering
population
per
statistical
5
unit)
and
using
a
dasymetric
distribution
of
population
by
building.
The
present
study
is
applied
on
the
Alenquer
river
basin
which
is
located
in
the
North
of
Lisbon
region
(Portugal).
In
the
last
decades
the
urban
sprawl
and
better
accessibilities
in
turn
off
Lisbon
metropolitan
area
led
to
an
occupation
of
former
agricultural
areas
which
are
landslide
prone
areas.
2
Study
area
The
study
area
is
the
Alenquer
river
basin
(120
km
2
),
which
is
located
north
of
Lisbon
(Fig.
1).
The
elevation
ranges
from
20
10
to
375
meters
and
the
major
landforms
are
hills
and
fluvial
valleys,
which
are
strongly
controlled
by
differences
in
resistance
and
plasticity
of
the
bedrock,
such
as
sandy-marl
(particularly
prone
to
rotational
landslides),
sandstone
and
limestone.
Field
work
and
aerial
photo
interpretation
allow
identifying
and
mapping
136
rotational
slides
(0.98
landslides/km
2
)
that
generated
a
total
unstable
area
of
663,508
m
2
(0.56
%
of
the
study
area).
Concerning
human
occupation,
the
study
area
has
15,253
inhabitants
(Census
2011)
that
area
mainly
concentrated
in
the
15
Alenquer
village
located
in
the
SE
sector
of
study
area.)The
population
is
also
present
in
scattered
small
“villages”,
where
agriculture
is
the
dominant
activity.
Cadastral
cartography
and
field
work
allows
to
identify
over
6,889
residential
building
s
that
were
considered
in
this
work.
Considering
the
Basic
Census
Unit
(BCU),
that
is
the
highest
Census
spatial
resolution
available
for
population
data,
the
area
is
covered
by
676
BCU
with
huge
ranging
surfaces
(minimum:
280
m
2
;
mean:
176,100
m
2
;
maximum:
4,4
km
2
).
The
mean
BCU
population
is
26
inhabitants
(not
considering
the
10
%
BCU
that
have
no
20
inhabitants)
and
the
maximum
population
per
BCU
is
357
inhabitants.
3
Data
and
methodology
The
most
detailed
public
information
about
population
available
in
Portugal
comes
from
national
census
Basic
Census
Unit
(BCU),
which
smaller
territorial
units
correspond
to
city
blocks.
However,
these
units
are
inhomogeneous
in
space,
and
consequently
in
number
of
buildings
and
inhabitants,
namely
in
rural
areas
or
transition
areas
between
urban
and
rural.
25
The
assessment
of
spatial
distribution
of
population
considering
a
conventional
statistical
terrain
unit
(BCU)
and
a
dasymetric
population
distribution
follows
three
main
steps
(Fig.
2):
(i)
the
landslide
susceptibility
assessment
for
two
spatial
units
(pixels
and
BCU);
(ii)
the
evaluation
of
population
density
considering
two
different
spatial
entities
(BCU
and
target
zones
within
BCU);
(iii)
the
calculation
of
potential
exposed
inhabitants
per
landslide
susceptibility
class
based
on
spatial
entities
referred
in
(ii).

1988),
which
is
a
Bayesian
bivariate
statistical
model
that
has
been
shown
to
be
suitable
for
landslides
susceptibility
assessment
(e.g.
Piedade
et
al.,
2011;
Guillard
and
Zêzere,
2011,
Pereira
et
al.,
2012;
Oliveira
et
al.,
2015
and
references
therein)
being
recommended
as
a
method
for
data-driven
landslide
susceptibility
assessment
worldwide
(Corominas
et
al.,
5
2014).
Landslide
inventory
was
based
on
field
work
and
interpretation
of
aerial
proto
interpretation
with
0.5
m
resolution.
The
landslide
database
includes
only
deep
rotational
slides
(rupture
surface
deeper
than
3m)
was
divided
in
two
independent
groups,
one
for
modelling
landslide
susceptibility,
and
other
for
independent
validation
of
landslide
susceptibility
models
based
on
a
temporal
criteria.
The
landslide
modelling
group
includes
all
the
rotational
slides
that
occurred
until
the
regional
landslide
event
of
march
2010
(Zêzere
and
Trigo,
2011)
(104
cases)
and
the
landslide
validation
group
includes
all
the
10
rotational
slides
that
occurred
during
that
landslide
event
(32
cases).
Six
landslides
predisposing
factors
were
use
as
independent
variables:
slope,
lithology,
land
use,
inverse
of
wetness
index,
morphostructural
units,
soil
type.
Lithology,
soil
type
and
land
use
were
based
on
national
official
cartography
at
1:25
000
scale.
The
slope
and
the
inverse
of
wetness
index
were
derived
from
a
digital
elevation
model
(DEM)
built
on
a
5
m
contours
topographical
map.
The
morphostructural
units
map
was
obtained
by
combining
the
aspect
map
derived
from
the
DEM
with
15
information
on
dipping
direction
of
lithological
layers
obtained
from
geological
maps
and
field
work.
The
susceptibility
model
was
further
validated
using
success
and
prediction
rate
curves
(Chung
and
Fabbri,
2003,
2008)
and
ca
lculating
the
area
under
the
curve
(AUC)
(Sweets,
1988).
The
final
susceptibility
model
was
made
with
a
5
m
resolution
and
was
classified
using
five
quantile
classes,
i.e.
each
landslide
susceptibility
class
includes
20
%
of
the
study
area.
In
a
subsequent
step
the
classified
pixel-based
landslide
20
susceptibility
map
was
overlaid
to
the
BCU
map
(vector
structure),
and
the
landslide
susceptibility
classification
attributed
to
each
BCU
was
defined
according
to
the
majority
landslide
susceptibility
class
represented
in
the
BCU.
3.2
Population
exposure
The
potential
exposed
population
to
landslide
risk
was
assessed
using
two
approaches:
(1)
considering
the
population
presented
within
each
BCU;
and
(2)
distributing
population
d
by
the
residential
buildings
within
each
BCU
using
dasymetric
25
cartography.
Dasymetric
cartography
is
a
classic
approach
(Wright,
1936)
that
has
been
recently
recovered
as
analytical
tool
based
on
Geo
graphical
Information
Systems
(e.g.
Eicher
and
Brewer,
2001;
Mennis
and
Hultgren,
2006).
The
dasymetric
cartography
use
ancillary
information
to
turn
into
a
finer
resolution
coarser
input
data.
A
set
of
target
zones
should
be
defined
and
then
based
on
areal
interpolation
or
other
weighting
algorithms
disaggregate
data,
estimating,
for
example,
population
in
a
set
of
smaller
30
units
based
on
a
known
amount
of
population
for
the
global
unit

and

Mennis,
2003;
Wu
et
al.,
2008;
Su
et
al.,
2010;
Tapp,
2010;
Holt
et
al.,
2013).
In
this
work
the
dasymetric
approach
was
anticipated
by
a
binary
analysis
over
residential
building/not
residential
building
areas
(Fig.
3).
Thus,
the
first
step
is
the
definition
of
target
zones.
In
this
work
a
layer
with
the
limits
of
residential
buildings
was
used.
Maantay
and
Maroko
(2009),
compared
three
different
disaggregation
methods,
and
identified
the
cadastral-based
one
(tax
lot)
as
the
best
approach
to
a
realistic
population
distribution/location.
By
overlaying
BCU
and
buildings
layer
(both
in
a
5
vector
structure)
it
is
possible
to
identify
in
each
statistical
unit
the
potentially
inhabited
places
(target
zones).
Considering
the
target
zones
and
the
BCU,
the
population
density
was
calculated.
To
compare
the
obtained
results
within
BCU
and
target
zones,
density
maps
were
classified
accordingly
to
standard
deviation
method.
The
second
step
is
the
weighting
of
each
target
zone
(Eq.
1),
i.e.
the
importance
of
each
building
(W
tzi
)
inside
a
specific
BCU
:
10
&#x1d44a;
&#x1d461;&#x1d467;&#x1d456;
=
&#x1d464;
&#x1d457;1
×
&#x1d464;
&#x1d457;2
×
…
×
&#x1d464;
&#x1d457;&#x1d45b;
(1)
where
w
j
are
the
parameters
used
as
proxies
to
weight
each
target
zone,
as
for
example,
for
each
building
polygon
the
surface,
number
of
residential
floors,
number
of
bedrooms,
occupation
rate,
among
others.
In
the
present
work
once
the
available
data
in
Census
(2011)
is
aggregate
at
BCU
level
and
the
ancillary
cadastral
information
(building)
has
only
the
outline
of
each
individual
house
just
one
weighting
parameter
was
considered,
the
area
of
15
the
building.
The
third
step
is
the
dasymetric
distribution
of
the
population
in
each
polygon
of
target
zones
(P
tzi
)
as
show
in
Eq.
2
(adapted
from
Su
et
al.,
2010):
&#x1d443;
&#x1d461;&#x1d467;&#x1d456;
=
&#x1d443;
&#x1d461;
×&#x1d44a;
&#x1d461;&#x1d467;&#x1d456;
∑
&#x1d44a;
&#x1d461;&#x1d467;&#x1d456;
&#x1d45b;
&nbsp;
&#x1d456;=1
(2)
where
W
tzi
is
the
weight
of
each
target
zone
in
the
BCU
and
P
t
is
total
population
in
the
BCU.
This
procedure
is
applied
20
independently
to
all
BCU
to
distribute
the
population
among
the
buildings
present
in
each
terrain
unit.
After
disaggregation
the
total
number
of
inhabitants
per
BCU
is
maintained.
The
last
step
is
the
assessment
of
the
number
of
people
exposed
in
each
susceptibility
class.
In
the
case
of
BCU
as
terrain
units,
the
assessment
is
direct
because
each
BCU
is
classified
within
a
single
landslide
susceptibility
class
(Sect.
3.1).
In
the
case
of
target
zones
(buildings)
as
terrain
units,
each
building
can
be
covered
by
more
than
one
landslide
susceptibility
class.
25
In
these
cases
it
was
necessary
to
convert
the
target
zones
from
vector
to
a
grid
structure,
coincident
with
the
5
m
resolution
susceptibility
map.
The
population
in
each
building
is
then
equally
distributed
among
the
pixels
that
compose
that
building.
For
example,
a
100
m2
building
(converted
in
4
pixels
of
5
per
5
meters)
that
has
8
inhabitants
will
have
in
the
final
population
distribution
2
inhabitants
in
each
pixel.

Results
Figure
4
show
the
obtained
landslide
susceptibility
maps
applied
in
a
pixel
based
map
(a)
and
in
a
BCU
vector
structure
based
map
(b)
according
to
the
dominant
susceptibility
class
inside
each
BCU.
The
visual
agreement
between
both
maps
is
evident
although
the
homogenization
of
the
susceptibility
classes
per
BCU
leads
to
an
increase
of
about
8%
of
the
area
classified
with
very
high
susceptibility.
However,
if
the
three
highest
susceptible
classes
are
combined
their
overall
5
representation
remains
equal
to
the
pixel
map
model
(60
%
of
the
total
study
area).
The
validation
of
the
landslide
susceptibility
map
(pixel
unit)
presents
acceptable
results
with
a
0.76
AUC
for
the
success
rate
curve
and
0.78
AUC
for
the
independent
validation
with
the
prediction
rate
curve.
When
evaluating
population
densities
the
use
of
different
spatial
units
(BCU
and
BCU
built-up
area)
shows,
as
expected,
considerable
differences
(Fig.
5).
In
fact,
if
a
common
approach
is
adopted
and
BCU
are
classified
accordingly
to
their
10
overall
area
(population
density
per
BCU
area),
density
values
(mean:
0.002
inhabitants/m2;
SD:
0.003)
are
around
one
order
of
magnitude
lower
when
compared
with
results
obtained
considering
only
the
built-up
area
(population
density
per
BCU
residential
building
area)
(mean:
0.011
inhabitants/m2;
SD:
0.009).
Additionally
Fig.
5
shows
that
whereas
in
high
building
density
terrain
units
(blue
outline
squares
example),
the
registered
population
density
hierarchy
remains
similar
in
maps
(a)
and
(b);
in
rural
terrain
units
(red
outline
squares
example)
differences
can
be
considerable
(more
than
two
standard
15
deviations
in
the
presented
example).
This
is
important
in
areas
as
the
study
case
where
the
majority
of
BCU
(73
%)
have
a
residential
built-up
area
under
20
%,
which
means
that
the
use
of
total
BCU
area
underestimate
the
population
density.
Figure
6
shows
the
obtained
results
for
the
three
highest
landslide
susceptible
classes
considering
the
population
presented
within
each
BCU
(approach
1)
and
distributed
by
the
residential
buildings
using
dasymetric
cartography
(approach
2).
It
is
20
clear
that
the
number
of
exposed
inhabitants
considerably
change
depending
on
the
method
used
to
estimate
population.
The
approach
1
systematically
generates
a
higher
number
of
inhabitants
(4465,
29%
of
total
inhabitants)
in
the
considered
landslide
susceptibility
classes
when
compared
with
approach
2
(1926,
13%
of
total
inhabitants).
The
difference
is
equivalent
to
132%,
which
means
that
2539
inhabitants
are
overestimated
when
using
approach
1.
prone
areas.

Discussion
and
conclusion
25
In
this
work,
two
different
approaches
were
used
to
evaluate
people
exposed
to
landslide
hazard
in
a
test
site
located
north
of
Lisbon
(Portugal).
The
consideration
of
the
total
population
per
BCU,
not
accounting
the
building
environment
(approach
1)
implies
the
generalization
of
the
landslide
susceptibility
map
from
the
raster
structure
to
the
BCU
terrain
unit.
On
contrary
,
the
approach
2
that
considers
target
zones
(buildings)
within
each
BCU
enable
the
use
of
the
original
landslide
susceptibility
map
with
a
5m
pixel.
30
In
fact,
surely
part
of
the
difference
of
132%
of
exposed
population
from
approach
2
to
approach
1
is
due
to
the
generalization
process
of
landslide
susceptibility
by
BCU,
which
can
generate
an
over-
or
underestimation
of
the
total
area
of

each
susceptibility
class.
As
a
consequence,
the
classification
of
the
same
building
can
be
very
diverse
in
the
two
produced
landslide
susceptibility
maps
(pixel-based
and
BCU-based)
(Fig.
7).
In
some
few
cases
a
building
located
in
a
very
high
susceptibility
class
in
the
pixel-based
map
is
classified
as
very
low
susceptibility
in
the
BCVU-based
map,
due
to
large
spatial
expression
of
that
class
within
the
BCU
terrain
unit
(Fig.
7b’).
In
the
majority
of
cases,
a
building
located
in
a
very
low
susceptibility
class
in
the
pixel-based
map
is
classified
as
very
high
susceptibility
in
the
BCVU-based
map
(Fig.
7a’
),
5
thus
overestimating
the
exposure
to
landslide
hazard.
The
use
of
the
majority
class,
as
classification
method,
in
the
BCU
susceptibility
map
is
a
source
of
error
that
tends
to
overestimate
exposure
of
buildings
and
indirectly
exposure
of
inhabitants.
An
analysis
should
be
done
to
the
previous
classification
of
the
susceptibility
map
(in
pixel
structure)
to
ensure
that
the
obtained
differences
are
not
due
to
the
considerable
changing
area
of
the
landslide
susceptibility
classes.
However,
independently
of
the
previous
tests
this
kind
of
10
approach
has
always
a
huge
degree
of
generalization
once
it
assumes
that
all
spatial
units
are
homogeneous
in
terms
of
landslide
susceptibility.
The
approach
2
does
not
require
the
generalization
of
landslide
susceptibility
and
this
is
a
major
advantage
of
the
method.
The
approach
2
is
a
user-friendly
methodology
that
allows
improving
the
accuracy
of
population
spatial
distribution
and
the
evaluation
of
the
number
of
inhabitants
exposed
to
a
hazardous
phenomenon.
Besides
the
abovementioned
advantage,
the
15
use
of
dasymetric
approach
for
the
population
distribution
reveals
two
additional
advantages:
(i)
the
increasing
of
population
resolution
which
allows
a
more
detailed
evaluation
of
the
number
of
inhabitants
potentially
affected
by
a
hazardous
event;
and
(ii)
the
location
of
people
is
confined
to
a
territory
(buildings)
that
present
physical
limits
(not
administrative)
that
can
be
easily
recognized
by
those
responsible
for
civil
protection
planning
and
emergency
management,
which
is
not
the
case
when
the
analysis
is
performed
in
a
grid
cell-based
map.
20
However,
some
uncertainties
related
to
the
dasymetric
population
distribution
are
present,
generally
associated
to
three
main
assumptions
that
have
to
be
adopted:
(i)
the
building
area
was
considered
as
the
only
proxy
of
the
number
of
people
inhabiting
per
building;
(ii)
people
inside
buildings
have
a
homogeneous
distribution;
and
(iii)
people
are
inside
the
buildings.
In
fact,
equal
building
areas
can
have
different
number
of
bedrooms,
different
number
of
floors
or
floors
with
different
uses
25
(e.g.
residential
or
commercial)
and
consequently
a
potentially
different
number
of
inhabitants,
which
is
probably
the
major
cause
of
uncertainty
of
the
present
study.
However,
in
this
study,
96%
of
the
buildings
are
in
the
same
class
considering
the
number
of
floors
(1-2),
and
buildings
with
higher
number
of
floors
are
located
in
urban
areas
where
the
size
of
the
BCU
is
smaller
and
homogeneous.
Therefore
we
are
confident
that
the
achieved
overall
population
distribution
values
are
representative
of
the
reality
in
the
study
area.
This
approach,
even
considering
some
uncertainties
related
to
people
30
distribution
inside
buildings,
particularly
in
the
more
susceptible
zones
is
definitely
closer
to
reality
than
when
considering
the
total
population
coming
from
BCU
(the
finest
public
population
information
available),
once
the
susceptibility
in
BCU
units
is
far
from
homogeneity.

The
homogeneous
distribution
of
people
inside
the
buildings
is
another
source
of
uncertainty
not
explored
in
this
study
due
to
lack
of
data.
Additionally
the
temporal
component
of
people
mobility
inside
each
building,
for
example,
day
or
night,
was
not
considered.
Moreover,
the
available
population
data
do
not
take
into
account
the
daily
fluctuation
to
work,
school
or
other
activities
outdoor.
Nonetheless,
in
this
specific
area
daily
or
seasonal
fluctuations
are
not
significant,
as
for
example
in
Lisbon
(Freire
and
Aubrecht,
2012).
5
Although
the
existing
uncertainty
in
this
work
due
to
people
are
considered
to
be
at
home,
Pereira
et
al.
(2015)
found
that,
in
Portugal
in
the
period
1865-2010,
the
majority
of
landslide
fatalities
occurred
with
people
indoor
(60%)
whereas
40%
occurred
outdoors
or
inside
a
transportation
vehicle.
Lastly,
despite
we
have
obtained
good
results,
these
may
still
be
improved
if
other
ancillary
information
is
available,
as
th
e
number
of
floors
per
building,
floating
population
(day/night,
summer/winter,
employment),
transport
data,
among
several
10
others,
to
better
characterize

From
the
point

the
Census

(available

free

in
Portugal)
and
the

(available

easily
acquirable
by
digital

interpretation),
as
ancillary
information
to
dasymetric
mapping
approach
prove
to
be
a
good
option
to
increase
population
distribution
resolution
at
the
regional/municipal

and
it
can
be
considered
as
a
first
approach
to
better
identify
locals
where
future
detailed

should
be
developed.
Additionally
it
allows
fast,
partial
(per

or
global,
upgrades
every
time
new
information
is
provided
about
population,
buildings
or
landslide
susceptibility.
